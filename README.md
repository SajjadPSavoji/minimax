# MiniMax

This project is a part of the course AI taught in University of Tehran.
main goal of project  is to make minimax agents to participate in a game and to test their performance.
then alpha-beta pruning is added to agents.

The result was that alpha-beta pruning will dramaricly reduce the time and
computation needed to selve the problem thus It will alow the agent to search 
in deeper stages.
